A sensor invariant Atmospheric Correction (SIAC)
================================================

This atmospheric correction method uses MODIS MCD43 BRDF product to get
a coarse resolution simulation of earth surface. A model based on MODIS
PSF is built to deal with the scale differences between MODIS and other
sensors, and linear spectral mapping is used to map between different
sensors spectrally. We uses the ECMWF
`CAMS <http://apps.ecmwf.int/datasets/data/cams-nrealtime/levtype=sfc/>`__
prediction as a prior for the atmospheric states, coupling with 6S model
to solve for the atmospheric parameters, then the solved atmospheric
parameters are used to correct the TOA reflectances. The whole system is
built under Bayesian theory and the uncertainty is propagated through
the whole system. Since we do not rely on specific bands' relationship
to estimate the atmospheric states, but instead a more generic and
consistent way of inversion those parameters. The code can be downloaded
from `SIAC <https://github.com/MarcYin/Atmospheric_correction>`__ github
directly and futrher updates will make it more independent and can be
installed on different machines.
