Testing
=======

We use `PyTest` in the MULTIPLY software. The test files are located in the `test` folder in the source directory.

They can be run e.g. via:

.. code-block:: bash

    pytest -vs

.. note::

   This section will describe testing routines used in the prior engine necessary for development.
