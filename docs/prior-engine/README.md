# MULTIPLY Prior Engine

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/multiply-org/prior-engine.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/multiply-org/prior-engine)
[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/multiply-prior-engine/badge/?version=latest)](https://multiply-prior-engine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)



This repository contains the prior engine for the MULTIPLY main platform.
It provides *a priori* information to the [Inference Engine](https://github.com/multiply-org/KaFKA-InferenceEngine) to support land surface parameter retrieval.
The [prior engine specific documentation](https://multiply-prior-engine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is hosted on ReadTheDocs. It is part of the [MULTIPLY core documentation](http://multiply.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
Please find the latest pdf version of this documentation [here](https://readthedocs.org/projects/multiply-prior-engine/downloads/pdf/latest/).


## Contents

* `aux_data/` Auxiliary data for prior generation.
* `docs` - The auto generated documentation of all prior engine classes and function definitions.
* `multiply_prior-engine/` - The main prior engine software package.
as source of information and orientation.
* `recipe` Conda installation recipe.
* `test/` - The test package.
* `setup.py` - main build script, to be run with Python 3.6
* `LICENSE.md` - License of software in repository.
<!-- * `helpers/` - Helper functions. -->

## How to install

The first step is to clone the latest code and step into the check out directory:

    $ git clone https://github.com/multiply-org/prior-engine.git
    $ cd prior-engine

The MULTIPLY platform has been developed against Python 3.6.
It cannot be guaranteed to work with previous Python versions.

The MULTIPLY prior engine can be run from sources directly.
To install the MULTIPLY prior engine into an existing Python environment just for the current user, use

    $ python setup.py install --user

To install the MULTIPLY Core for development and for the current user, use

    $ python setup.py develop --user

## Module requirements

- `python-dateutil`
- `gdal`
- `matplotlib`
- `numpy`
- `pyyaml`
- `shapely`


## Usage

### Python Package

MULTIPLY prior engine is available as Python Package.
To import it into your python application, use

```python
import multiply_prior_engine
```

### Command Line Interface

There is a Command Line Interface (CLI) integrated to allow for the following actions:

- add user defined prior data,
- import user defined prior data,
- remove/un-select prior data from configuration,
- show configuration.

The CLI's help can be accessed via `-h` flag:

``` bash
user_prior -h
```

The help and description of the above mentioned sub-commands can be accessed via, e.g.:

``` bash
user_prior add -h
```

### Current limitations in the user defined priors

So far, priors can only be added as point data for specific variables. User defined prior data has to be passed to the engine in the form of comma separated values (csv) with dates in the first column and the parameter values in the second column.
There is the requirement for a header line specifying the variable name (lai, sm, ...) and geolocation (latitude, longitude) of the data.
E.g.:

```
lai, 10.5564, 48.3124
2017-06-01, 1.01
2017-06-02, 1.01
2017-06-03, 1.2
2017-06-04, 1.25
2017-06-05, 1.4
....
```


## Generating the Documentation

We use [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/rest.html) to generate the documentation of the MULTIPLY platform on [ReadTheDocs](http://multiply.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

The source files of the main documentation of the MULTIPLY platform is to be found in the [MULTIPLY core repository](https://github.com/multiply-org/multiply-core).

If there is a need to build the *prior engine specific* docs locally, these additional software packages are required:

    $ conda install sphinx sphinx_rtd_theme mock
    $ conda install -c conda-forge sphinx-argparse
    $ pip install sphinx_autodoc_annotation

To regenerate the HTML docs, type

    $ cd doc
    $ make html


## Contribution and Development

Once, the package is set up, you are very welcome to contribute to the MULTIPLY Prior Engine.
